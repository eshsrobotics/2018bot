    <!-- Most Linux distributions supply the /etc/os-release file, which looks
         like a standard Java properties file and has a consistent syntax.  It
         is part of the Linux Standards Base.

         The following line imports all of its properties into Ant as-is (except for
         the common "lsb." prefix.)  The best thing is that Ant doesn't care if the
         properties file does not exist (see
         https://ant.Apache.org/manual/Tasks/property.html), so this is safe
         to run on Windows, too, merely giving us an empty set of properties).

         To use one of these properties, simply create a <condition/> that uses
         the key and then test for the condition:

           <condition property="is_debian_or_ubuntu">
             <or>
               <matches string="${lsb.ID}" pattern="debian" casesensitive="false" />
               <matches string="${lsb.ID}" pattern="ubuntu" casesensitive="false" />
             </or>
           </condition>
           <echo message="Only print this on Debian or Ubuntu" if:set="${is_debian_or_ubuntu}"
    -->
    <property file="/etc/os-release" prefix="lsb" />

    <!-- The most important condition in this file: are we on Raspian or not? -->
    <condition property="is_raspberry_pi">
        <and>
            <os family="unix"/>
            <!-- Raspberry Pi 3s are 64-bit, but run a 32-bit Raspian OS.

            <!-- <os arch="i386"/> -->
            <matches string="${lsb.ID}" pattern="raspian" casesensitive="false" />
        </and>
    </condition>
    <!-- The following are just test conditions for playing around; they has
         no real significance. -->
    <condition property="is_mga32">
        <and>

                     libraries, each corresponding to one of the two platforms
                     we target during development:

                     - lib/NetworkTables-x.y.z-arm-raspbian.jar: The ARM32
                       build, appropriate for Raspberry Pis running Raspian
                       (these are our standard development platforms because
                       they are cheap);

                     - lib/NetworkTables-x.y.z-desktop.jar: A standard build
                       for both 32- and 64-bit desktop machines, such as the
                       MageiaLinux box I'm trying this from or the driver
                       stations that we use for deploying to the robot.

                     We only need one of the two in the classpath, so we use
                     Ant's OS detection logic to create condition objects for
                     us, then use the condition objects to include the right
